Use cases
=========

Use cases are a way of describing how the system will satisfy its requirements.

A use case shows a scenario where one or more actors use the system.

Properties of a use case:

-   The use case has a **name** describing what the **scenario** accomplishes, e.g., "play a game of TicTacToe".  That is the **goal** of the scenario.
-   The **actors** are agents **external** to the system. They might be human users. Or, they could be other software systems.
-   An actor must be an **initiator** of the use case. In other words, the **scenario** described by the use case must be a response to an actor requesting that the system do something to achieve the initiator's goal.
-   The use case has a well-defined beginning and end. The end of the use case is the achievement of a **goal** (normal/expected outcome), or possibly an error (alternate path).

Note that although the use case will generally specify a sequence of steps, these steps must focus on WHAT the actor or actors experience, and NOT how the system achieves the functionality. So, the use case must not mention objects, methods, code, etc. The use case should also not describe the user interface: that is a separate activity.

There may be multiple paths through a use case. For example: if an error occurs, or if there is "optional" behavior seen in some cases, etc.

There are different ways of writing a use case. For some use cases, a single sentence might suffice. For more fully-specified use cases, listing a series of numbered steps is a good approach. As with any documentation, diagram, model, etc., the purpose is to specify an aspect of the system in enough detail to be useful, but not too much detail. Excessive detail is a waste of time.

So what does a use case look like?  Here's the example from "UML Distilled", including alternate paths, called extensions:

**Buy a Product from an Online Store**

MSS - Main Success Scenario:

	1. Customer **browses catalog and selects items to buy**

	2. Customer goes to check out

	3. Customer fills in shipping information (address, shipping info)

	4. System provides full pricing info, including shipping

	5. Customer fills in credit card info

	6. System authorizes purchase

	7. System confirms sale immediately

	8. System sends confirming email to customer

Extensions (alternate paths):

	3a: Customer is a regular customer

		.1: System provides current shipping, pricing, and billing information
		
		.2: Customer may accept or override those defaults, returns to MSS at step 6
		
	
	6a: System fails to authorize credit purchase

		.1: Customer may re-enter credit card info (returns to MSS at step 5)
		
		.2: Customer may cancel purchase
	

**Let's work a Use Case example: Web-Enabled Vending Machine:**

Think about the **requirements** and **use cases** for a modern, web-enabled vending machine.  How could such a vending machine be used?

Basic hardware features:
 
   1) Connected to Internet
   
   2) Can accept cash, credit/debit cards, and electronic forms of payment
   
   3) Can detect if/when product has been dispensed
   
   4) Can monitor inventory and cash on-hand
   
   5) Can detect maintenance issues
   
   6) Can "see" - has camera(s)
   
   7) Can "hear" - has microphone
   
   8) Can "talk" - has speaker
   
   9) Knows location - is GPS-enabled
   
Use your imagination, as engineers - what functions, actions, requirements, use cases are possible for a vending machine with the given hardware?
   
Now, the project teams will do this as an exercise on the white boards, as an example for creating a use case.
   
-	Think very broadly - how could the vending machine be used?

-   Who are the possible actors?

-	What are some of the requirements (besides the given hardware)?

-	What are some scenarios in which the vending machine plays a role?

-	Now let's pick a scenario and construct a use case for that scenario.

-	What requirement or requirements did this use case include / address?
